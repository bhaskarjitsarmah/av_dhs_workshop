    "## Hallucination\n",
    "\n",
    "`Hallucination` refers to instances where the model generates information that sounds plausible but is actually incorrect or made up. This happens because the model fills in gaps or patterns in its training data without verifying the facts. It's like confidently telling a story with details that aren't real.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if a response from a language model (LLM) is reliable, we can use a method that involves generating multiple sample responses and comparing them to the original response. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate Samples**: Use the same LLM that produced the original response to generate several additional sample responses to the same prompt.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Consistency Check**: Compare the original response with each of these samples to see how consistent they are. This involves two main checks:\n",
    "   - **LLM-based Check**: Ask the LLM itself to assess the consistency between the original response and each sample. This is done in halves and the scores are averaged.\n",
    "   - **Semantic Similarity Check**: Measure how similar the meaning of each sentence in the original response is to the corresponding sentences in the samples. These scores are averaged as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Hallucination Score**: Combine the results of the LLM-based check and the semantic similarity check to get a final score. This score helps determine how much you can trust the original response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Credits: `Langkit` - The implemention defiend is taken from it and as per the library the approch is inspired from [SelfCheckGPT: Zero-Resource Black-Box Hallucination Detection for Generative Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896)"
